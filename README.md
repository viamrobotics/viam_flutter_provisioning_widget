# Viam Flutter Provisioning Widget

This package provides a convenient way to import and use all available provisioning methods in your Flutter project.

This package currently wraps:
- [viam_flutter_bluetooth_provisioning](https://github.com/viamrobotics/viam_flutter_bluetooth_provisioning_widget)
- [viam_flutter_hotspot_provisioning](https://github.com/viamrobotics/viam_flutter_hotspot_provisioning_widget)

You can either use `ProvisioningFlowFactory` to generate a provisioning flow. Or use classes from the above packages directly. 

Reading the individual package `README`s is required to get started and ensure your project is setup correctly for the flows you want to support.

flutter pub add viam_flutter_provisioning_widget
